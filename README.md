Distributed Network Intrusion Detection System

Disclaimer

This work was carried out during a master's dissertation, to develop a simulation of a distributed intrusion detection system using machine learning technologies and multi-agent systems.

Setup

This application was developed using JADE, Pycaret and Flask.

To redo the simulation, there are two README.md files in the jade_experiments and python folders that demonstrate the step-by-step process to run everything.
